# hoturl - speech input
iOS app for saving urls in a list. 

## Goals and things I've learned with this app
* Speech Input and speech processing
* Saving with Core Data
* Making big changes to the codebase

### Rework
On the branch **rework** I've made some adjustments and tried some things out. The goal was just to make some changes to the existing code. Get out of that comfort zone.

### Note
Dode might not be 100% clean. Main goal was to do something with speech input and learn stuff about the TableView.
